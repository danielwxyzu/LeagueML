# LeagueML
A personal project by Daniel, focusing on developing problem solving and data/computer science skills.

The main data set used is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/barthetur/league-of-legends-2024-competitive-game-dataset/data

The other data set found within the 'old files' folder is pulled directly from Game of Legends eSports: https://gol.gg/teams/list/season-S15/split-ALL/tournament-ALL/

Some goals for this project:
- Finish development in time for League of Legends Worlds '25 pick'ems
- Be able to prompt with two teams that are going head to head and return a probability of who will win
- Find other interesting points of insight hidden within the data!
- Become a more curious and skilled 'problem solver'
