# LeagueML
A personal project by Daniel W, focusing on developing problem solving and data/computer science skills.

I'm pausing work on the project as of 5/1/25 to learn more about machine learning methods but also develop better programming skills. I'll likely revisit in a month or two after I've done some studying. So far my work is able to return win probabilities with user inputed team names but there are a lot of limitations and errors. The final league_win_predictor was also largely coded using AI but everything else was done manually with my limited knowledge and skill set likely contributing to the highly inaccurate model.

The main data set used is from a League of Legends database: https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads

The other data set found within the 'old files' folder is pulled directly from Game of Legends eSports: https://gol.gg/teams/list/season-S15/split-ALL/tournament-ALL/

Some goals for this project:
- Finish development in time for League of Legends Worlds '25 pick'ems
- Be able to prompt with two teams that are going head to head and return a probability of who will win
- Find other interesting points of insight hidden within the data
- Become better at structuring problems and then solving them
