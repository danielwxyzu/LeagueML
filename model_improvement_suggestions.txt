Model Improvement Suggestions for League Win Predictor

1. Feature Scaling Issues
   - Currently scaling features twice: once in FeatureEngFinal.py and again in predictor
   - Scaler is being applied to already scaled data, amplifying differences
   - Consider leaving weighted_objective_diff unscaled
   - Review scaling methodology for each feature type

2. Feature Difference Calculation
   - Current raw difference between team features might be too simplistic
   - Consider using ratios instead of differences for certain features
   - Recent_form is already probability-like, differences might not be appropriate
   - Explore different feature comparison methods (e.g., relative strengths)

3. Model Training Issues
   - Logistic regression might be overfitting to training data
   - Feature weights in weighted_objective_diff might be too extreme
   - Consider adding regularization to the model
   - Review model hyperparameters and training methodology

4. Data Quality Issues
   - Using only most recent data point might not be representative
   - Rolling average window of 5 games might be too small
   - Check for imbalanced classes or outliers
   - Consider data normalization and outlier treatment

5. Feature Selection
   - Current features might be too correlated
   - Consider adding missing important features
   - Feature interactions aren't being captured
   - Review feature importance and correlation analysis

Improvement Recommendations:

1. Revise Feature Engineering
   - Avoid double scaling of features
   - Use ratios or other transformations instead of raw differences
   - Add more sophisticated features like team strength ratings
   - Consider feature-specific scaling approaches

2. Improve Model Training
   - Add regularization to logistic regression
   - Try different model architectures
   - Use cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning
   - Implement proper train/test/validation splits

3. Enhance Data Processing
   - Increase window size for rolling averages
   - Use multiple recent games instead of just most recent
   - Add historical performance context
   - Implement proper data validation

4. Add Model Calibration
   - Use calibration techniques for more realistic probabilities
   - Consider more sophisticated probability models
   - Add uncertainty estimates
   - Implement proper probability calibration

Next Steps:
1. Review and revise feature engineering pipeline
2. Implement proper scaling methodology
3. Add regularization to the model
4. Consider alternative feature comparison methods
5. Add more sophisticated team strength metrics
6. Implement proper model evaluation and validation
7. Add probability calibration
8. Consider ensemble methods for more robust predictions
